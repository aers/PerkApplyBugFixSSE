# Perk Apply Bug Fix SSE

skse64 plugin to fix the double perk apply bug documented [here](https://requiem.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RD/blog/2016/06/19/61472833/Is+Requiem+too+hardcore+No+but+there+s+an+engine+bug+that+makes+it+look+so+unless+you+deal+with+it)

This is an implementation of the method meh321 used to fix the bug in Skyrim: LE in his [bug fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/76747) mod; all credit for the method goes to him.

May cause CTDs or unknown behavior because I don't entirely know what I'm doing ;-)

For SSE 1.5.39/skse64 2.0.7
